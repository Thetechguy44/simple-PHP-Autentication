# Simple-Page-PHP-Autentication
This is a simple page authentication which assigned a unique random id to a new sign up user. 
It's also check if the inputs provided for authentication is valid or in valid. A function was created to check the provided details from the user to check for the validity
I attached the database in the repository, you can import the database to your mysql server for testing.
